This is a sprig game i made for hack club arcade!
A simple turn-based strategy game with silly gameplay and silly graphics to match
HOW TO PLAY:
The goal of the game is to knock out the red square - There are no attacks yet though
There are two numbers beneath the grass: Time until move (top), and cycle (bottom)
Your stats are in the top left, labeled [H] for health and [S] for stamina, and the red squares are in the top right
You can queue a move action by pressing either A (left) or D (right), which will queue your character to move in that direction 1 square
You can modify a movement queue by pressing S, which will make it move 2 squares in the previously queued direction
Your queued movement will take place once the time until move reaches zero, and will reduce your stamina by the number of squares moved. Your move will be canceled if you do not have enough stamina.

After every move, even if you or the red square did not make a move, the cycle counter will tick up. When the cycle counter reads 3, you will heal after that cycle's movement timer. The cycle will then reset to 1.
